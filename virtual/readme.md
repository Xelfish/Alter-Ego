<h1> Virtual Pi Architecture </h1>

<p> This is used as a documentation for the PI setup, handling and communication </p>
<p> At the time of development there was no access to two working and properly connected Raspberry PIs.</p>
<p> Once the draft is complete we need to move the content of "pi-input" onto the first "INPUT" pi and the content of "pi-output"onto the second "OUTPUT" pi </p>
